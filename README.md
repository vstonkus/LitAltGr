# A Lithuanian (Programmers) keyboard

Switching between US and Lithuanian keyboards is pain. Especially when you need to type numbers and symbols.

The default layout is US; the Lithuanian characters are available by holding down the right Alt (AltGr) key.

Thanks to @gintas initial [project](https://github.com/gintas/LitAltGr). However according to [RC](https://www.registrucentras.lt/litwin/keyboard.html) the layout created by @gintas is rather "Lithuanian (Baltic)" but not "Lithuanian (Programmers)".

I've added "Lithuanian (Programmers)" layout which is now a mix between "Lithuanian (Baltic)" and "Lithuanian (Programmers)" so Lithuanian characters are available not only on numbers row, but you can also use letter A(+AltGr) to type "Ä„" for example.

I've also created two separate layouts for US and LT languages. You can use single layout for both languages in Windows, or you might not need Lithuanian language anymore, but in that case language proofing tools would only work for English. I use separate Lithuanian language for LT proofing tools. The good thing is that you don't need to swith language for typing, but only for proofing tools.


The Euro sign is also available (AltGr+Shift+").

The keyboard file was generated using Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4.

Installation
============
* Run ltprog/setup.exe
* Run usltprog/setup.exe
* Language settings -> English -> Options -> Remove US (QUERTY) *"Lithuanian (AltGr)" should already be there*
* Language settings -> Lithuanian -> Options -> Remove Lithuanian (QUERTY) *"Lithuanian (AltGr)" should already be there*
* Restart PC

That's it, you don't need to switch languages to type lithuanian characters, but only for proofing tools to work when you need it.
